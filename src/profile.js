    "Hello there!👋, I am Ishan Avasthi born in 2005 in India. I am an upcoming developer, I am learning something new everyday. I love developing tools/sites/apps that solve real problems or help make someone's life easier. I like impactful work. Besides coding, I'm also very passionate about traveling and reading. I feel like the world is a book that was given to me for exploring when I was born, and I don't wanna die before reading all the pages. I plan to become a nomad someday and explore the endless beauty that this planet homes.",
